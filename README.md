# Text-Recognition
This repository is an extention for our [another project](https://github.com/dkozykowski/flutter_project) consisting a
model created with Deep Learning technique written with [Keras - the Python Deep Learning library](https://keras.io) 
under [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) backend.

## How does it work?
The model was trained on thousands of handwritten texts using unsupervised learning. It will be capable of recognizing text written
on the given photo and returning raw text with symbols.

## What will it be able to recognite?
- digits
- letters
- special characters
- mathematical symbols
- matrices
- vectors
